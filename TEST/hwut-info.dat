Regression Tests on fixed bugs

bash *.sh

BRIEF:

This directory contains regression tests on bugs that were found and fixed.
A number identifies the bug as it has been logged on HWUT's sourceforge but
tracker.

EXPLANATION:

The following files help to develop unit tests on HWUT's behavior:

 * hwut_greet.sh 

   Provides a standardized response to '--hwut-info' where submitter, bug
   identifier, and title have a specific format.

 * hwut_call.sh    

   Calls HWUT in a given sub directory. For this call, the variable 
   HWUT_TEST_DIR_NAME is defined as the directory where the test shall be 
   executed. That is, 

              > hwut_call.sh 15

   Sets HWUT_TEST_DIR_NAME=15, and HWUT will run only in the directory 15
   as the TEST directory.
