Make sure that modules do not use 'os.path.relpath'.
This causes trouble under Windows with driver letters.
They shall use 'hwut.auxiliary.path.relative(...)' instead.

./hwut/auxiliary/path.py:272:    """The 'relpath' may fail on operating systems, that have 'drive letters'.
./hwut/auxiliary/path.py:276:        result = os.path.relpath(Path, RDir)
