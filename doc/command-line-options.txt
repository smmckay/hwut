The services provided by HWUT are: testing, accepting test results as 'good', displaying
differences, reviewing information on past tests, and cleaning. The associated command line
options are:

.Table for services provided by HWUT.
`------------------------`-------------------------------------------------------
Call to Service          Service Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`hwut`                    Runs one or more test.
`hwut diff` _appl_        Use _appl_ to display last test run an 'good' case. 
`hwut d` _appl_           - same - 
`hwut accept`             Accepts last test output for good.
`hwut a`                  - same -
`hwut info`               Displays information about previous tests.
`hwut i`                  - same - 
`hwut clean`              Delete HWUT-unrelated files from TEST directories.
                          If a makefile exists, it calls `make clean`.
`hwut c`                  - same - 
`hwut mostlyclean`        Delete HWUT-unrelated files from TEST directories.
                          If a makefile exists, it calls `make mostlyclean`.
`hwut mc`                 - same -

If these service calls are done without any further argument, then HWUT searches
for all TEST directories starting from the current directory. Then it performs the
specified service for each TEST directory that it found. Calls to HWUT services
follow all the same scheme:

Call without arguments (e.g. `> hwut `)::

   Starting from the current directory all subdirectories with name `TEST`
   are searched for and then the service is performed on all files of those
   directory.

Call with the name of a test program (e.g. `> hwut accept my_script.py`)::

   Services is performed with resped to calls of all possible choices
   to the given test program.


Call with the name of a test program (e.g. `> hwut info str-test 7bit`)::

   Service is performed with respect to the given test program and the
   given choice only.
    
The `--fail` mentioned below allows to filter out experiments that are failed
in the previous test run.  Note, that the specification of a test program for
the clean service is meaningless.  The following command line options modify
the mechanism of quex:

`-e`, `--exec`::

   Execute test programs before doing any action on the output. This option is relevant
   for the `diff`, `info`, and `accept` services.

`--fail`::

   Consider only files that failed in the last test run.

`--grant`, `--no-grant`::

   These options allow to avoid acknowledgement questions that are asked to confirm
   that the user really wants to perform a certain action. `--grant` means that
   all questions asked are answered with `all` and `--no-grant` means that all 
   actions are answered with `none`.

`-h`, `--help`::
   
    Prints some basic help text.
				   
`--make` _target_::

   If specified causes HWUT to call `make` for the given target whenever the test of
   a directory are terminated.


`-v`, `--version`::

    Prints the version information about the hwut application.
