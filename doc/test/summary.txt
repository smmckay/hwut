Testing with HWUT is based on the output of a test program to the standard
output. The output of a nominal run that was proven to ge good is taken as a
reference for any later run. During later runs simply the output of the current
test program is compared to the previous outputs. If a comparison fails, 
     HWUT prints out a failure notice. If an output of a program is to be 
     accepted HWUT can be called with the `accept` option. This causes
     quex to store the current output of a test program as a reference.

Note, however, that HWUT is able to recursively search through a directory
tree for `TEST/` directories and executes the tests. At the time of this
writing the quex lexical analyzer generator, for example, contains TEST
directories in the following directories of its program:

..................................................................
    ./quex/core_engine/state_machine/TEST
    ./quex/core_engine/generator/TEST
    ./quex/core_engine/regular_expression/TEST
    ./quex/core_engine/TEST
    ./quex/TEST
    ./quex/frs_py/TEST
    ./quex/code_base/buffer/iconv/TEST
    ./quex/code_base/buffer/TEST
    ./quex/code_base/template/TEST
    ./demo/TEST
...................................................................

If HWUT was called in the directory `./` then it would step through all these
directories, perform all tests and print a summary of the experiments in the 
visited directories such as:

...................................................................
    SUMMARY:
    ./demo/TEST ...................................[OK]
    ./quex/TEST ...................................[OK]
