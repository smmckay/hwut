HWUT can be downloaded from sourceforge.net, see http://hwut.sourceforge.net.
Once you have the package extract the files into a directory of your choice.
Then set the environment variable `HWUT_PATH` to this directory. The set a link
from the file `hwut-exe.py` to `hwut` in a directory where your operating
system can find executables. In some cases you might set executable rights for
`hwut-exe.py` and `hwut`. That is all. On a Unix system with a bash shell, this
could be done with the following steps:

[shell]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> tar xfz hwut-x.y.z.tar.gz                       # extract
> chmod u+x hwut/hwut-exe.py                      # executable rights
> ln hwut/hwut-exe.py /usr/local/bin/hwut         # link
> echo "export HWUT_PATH="`pwd`"/hwut" >> .bashrc # HWUT_PATH

Python should be installed on your system. If not consider downloading it from
http://python.org. Also the `find` utility should be available.  This is
generally the case for Unix systems. On Windows based machines it is advisable
to run HWUT in a cygwin environment (see http://cygwin.com).  For testing on
compiled code the `make` utility has to be intalled.  Installation of software
to display differences (diff, vimdiff, etc.) is optional.
