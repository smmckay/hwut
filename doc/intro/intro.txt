The goal of HWUT is to provide a very easy means to test software during the
development phases. The abbreviation H.W.U.T. stands for 'Hello Worldler's Unit
Test', but its applications reach beyond usual unit tests where only functions
of an API are checked.  Moreover, it allows for system tests where sequences or
complex structure evolutions are monitored. All this is achieved with a very
simple principle: The comparison between the output of the 'good' test program
and the program under test. This way, HWUT is operating system and programming
language independent. At the same time tests can be setup literally in minutes. 

Users interested only in the application of HWUT might skip this chapter.
However, the best way to deal with it is to read the introduction, and then
take a nap, go for lunch, or take a cup of coffee and let your mind develop
some apatite for the chapters to come. You may also watch some of the published
documentation movies that explain the use of HWUT.  Everything about HWUT is
easy. So, make sure that you feel cool when you go through this documentation.
