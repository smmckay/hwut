<h1 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">What is this?</span></h1>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It's about Unit
Tests. That means, if someone programs some functionality and want to
be able to see at any time that it is working, he writes a test -- a
Unit Test. It is essential that those tests are fully automated. This
way, at any&nbsp;change to the surrounding software it is possible to
check wether&nbsp;any sub-functionality&nbsp; is effected. On the other
hand, writing Unit Tests is sometimes very boring and the hesitations
not to to it are as big as the temptation to go on programming on the
next issue. Additionally, many Unit Test Tools come with some
complexity to be understood in order to propperly use its
functionality. The <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold;">Hello-Worldler's Unit Test</span> shall enable anyone able to get '<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">hello world</span>' on the screen to write Unit Tests. And this works as follows:<br>

<br> </span> <h1 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><span style="font-family:
    Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">How does this work?</span></h1> <span
style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The philosophy as simple as
can be. It is assumed that the only thing that is important to someone runing a
Unit Test is to see which sub-functionalities are working and which are not.
For a single test this means one only has to compare a good result (one that is
be acknowledged to be acceptable) with a current result. As a consequence of
this philosophy, the HWUT only requests the application to write something to
the standard output (i.e. using <span style="font-family: Courier
    New,Courier,monospace;">print</span> in Python, <span style="font-family:
    Courier New,Courier,monospace;">printf</span> in C, or <span
    style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">cout</span> in
C++)&nbsp; that has something to do with its functionality. HWUT compares this
with some previous text that has been stored as 'good' and tells wether both
outputs are the same or not. There are no <span style="font-style:
    italic;">Asserts</span>, no <span style="font-style:
    italic;">Comparison</span> <span style="font-style:
    italic;">Operators</span> or what so ever. Also, it does not matter in 
what programming language you are programming. The only restriction is that
this language allows you to write something to the standard output. Thus 
the very large majority of programming languages can be used here.&nbsp; </span><br> <br>

<h1 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">How do I use HWUT?</h1>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">First of all,
you need some *nix. Maybe later versions will run under other OS-es.
Now, change to the directory where you currently implement some functionality (cd my/favorite/dir).
Make a subdirectory call './TEST' and change to it (mkdir ./TEST). Now, write your test program
in whatever language you want and make it executable (chmod u+x filename). If this is not
practical since it needs to be compiled write a Makefile that generates an executable
program of your test when you do a 'make all'. In this case, the Makefile should also
contain a rule to 'make clean'. HWUT searches for a Makefile in the ./TEST directory and
tries to build test application using 'make all'. When you are sure that the ouput
of your program is correct, then say:

hwut --good test-program-name --exec

This will stimulate HWUT to write the output into the ./GOOD subdirectory. This output
is then taken as reference. Make sure that the test program uses the same resources
(header files and libraries) as your later software does. Otherwise, it does not make
any sense to repeat the tests. Before you go on, you need to ensure that your mini-program
tells HWUT about its name. For this you need to make your program to respond to 
a command line argument '--test-info' as a first argument with the title of your test
to the standard output (using 'printf' or whatsoever) and exit. Note, that a ':' inside
your title is considered to be a 'grouping' token. That means, that if you let one
application respond with 'Pacman: Eating Ghosts' and another with 'Pacman: Eating Dots'
than those two applications will be grouped under 'Pacman' and 'Eating Ghosts' and
'Eating Dots' are subchapters. That is all. Unit tests can be performed.
Whenever you change now something in your program
you can always change to your ./TEST directory and run

hwut

This will perform the unit tests on all files that are executable and compare the results
with the 'good; results. The final verdict tells you if everything workedout fine, or not.
It is usually a good idea to build a directory tree for modules and sub-modules. Now,
if you want to run the unit tests for the whole set of sub-modules, simply change directory
to the main directory of your project and type 'HWUT'. The program searches for all
./TEST directories, walks down there, performs the tests and reports a summary on all
results.
</span>
<h1 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">OK, What Else?</h1>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
If you spot an error and type

hwut --diff test-program-name

then HWUT will run the diff utility in order to determine the difference between the
nominal and the actual output of your test program. Typing

hwut --clean

lets HWUT walk down the ./OUT and ./GOOD directory and delete all files that are not HWUT related.

hwut --all-good

performs all tests and copies the results to the ./GOOD directory. This means, that all tests
are considered to be a referene for future tests.
</span>
<h1 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Installation?!</h1>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    Download the hwut.zip file. 
    Copy the python file hwut.py into a directory that is known to contain executables (e.g. /usr/share/bin), or
    change your PATH variable accordingly.
    You might rename the file to 'hwut', i.e. forget about the .py extension because this looks cooler. But do not forget to 
    make it executable (chmod a+x /usr/shar/bin/hwut). Then you're ready to bring it on.
</span>
<h1 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Licensing?!</h1>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    HWUT is distributed under LPGL as long as you are not using it for any military related purposes. This means that you can use it without restriction as long as you are not getting involved into the development of anyhting that can kill people. For such projects there is no licence of HWUT.
