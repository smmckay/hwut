The copyright system grew up with printing-a technology for
mass production copying. Copyright fit in well with this
technology because it restricted only the mass producers of
copies. It did not take freedom away from readers of books.
An ordinary reader, who did not own a printing press, could
copy books only with pen and ink, and few readers were sued
for that.
